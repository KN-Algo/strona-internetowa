Our physical chessboard was equipped with a CoreXY mechanism and a system of electromagnets, thanks to which the pieces can move automatically. What's more – the game can be played in two ways:<br>♟️ through a web application<br>♟️ or traditionally – by moving pieces by hand, which are immediately detected thanks to magnetic sensors.<br><b>Checkmate 2.0</b> is not an ordinary board, but a truly interactive system that combines elements of computer science, automation, mechatronics, and algorithmics 🤖<br>During the workshops, everyone could compete with our proprietary chess engine. There were emotions, joy, and lots of fun – both children and adults eagerly took up the challenge 💪<br>The best players were rewarded with gadgets from our society, and we had great satisfaction seeing how much joy our project brought.<br>🙏 We sincerely thank everyone who joined us. We are pleased that we could share the result of our work with you – these are the moments that motivate us to continue working.<br>⚡ <b>And this is just the beginning!
