    'marta-lampasiak-description' => "Marta Lampasiak, M.Sc. graduated in 2022 with a degree in Automation and Robotics from the Faculty of Electronics. She started working at the Department of Computer Science and Telecommunications at Wrocław University of Science and Technology the same year. She mainly teaches subjects related to programming and information technology, however, her research interests include: modeling and identification of dynamic systems, control system design and simulation studies. She is currently working on her PhD and conducting research and often presents the results at international scientific conferences. Her work at Wrocław University of Science and Technology allows her to combine two aspects without which she cannot imagine her life: gaining knowledge and passing it on to others. For M.Sc. Marta Lampasiak, teaching work, including the atmosphere in her classes, is as important as scientific work, as evidenced, for example, the title of laureate in the Quintus Program, in which students choose instructors who stand out for their commitment and manner of conducting classes.",

    'jacek-jagodzinski-description' => "Dr. Eng. Jacek Jagodzinski graduated with a degree in Automation and Robotics from the Faculty of Electronics, also received his PhD from Wrocław University of Science and Technology, and started working at the same university in 2017. He teaches subjects related to industrial automation in the broadest sense, IoT, signal processing and much more. It's also worth mentioning that his doctoral thesis concerned issues related to robotics. Meanwhile, in his scientific work, he mainly focuses on creating models of systems (not only those related to automation), their identification and estimation in general. Dr. Eng. Jacek Jagodzinski is the supervisor of the Laboratory of Automation Devices and Systems, and when it comes to his teaching work, the best proof of his commitment, as well as his ingenuity in coming up with more and more new project topics for implementation, are the graduates, both in engineering and master's studies, of which he had the pleasure of being the supervisor. In addition, it should be mentioned that he has extensive experience working on research projects.",
